#AT90 Microcontroller Lab Climate control free running mode

Exercise 1 â€“ Free running mode

Write a C program for the AT90 that accomplishes the following tasks:

1. The ADC is configured to free running mode, 8-bit resolution, input from potentiometer 1
(ADC2).

2. The LEDs (PORTC) are all turned on

3. When potentiometer 1 increases, LEDs will be turned off from left to right.

4. When potentiometer 1 decreases, LEDs will be turned on from right to left.

5. The program continues from step 3.

*ADC Initialization (ADC_init)

*The ADC is set to free-running mode, meaning it continuously samples data.

*The prescaler is set to 128, which is needed for an 8 MHz clock to achieve a stable ADC conversion.

*The ADC input is set to ADC2, meaning it reads values from the potentiometer connected to that channel.

*The ADC is configured to 8-bit resolution, using left-adjusted results.

*The ADC conversion starts immediately
